<h1> The Rise of COVID-19 in PG County </h1>
<h2> How the community is dealing with the nation-wide pandemic. </h2>
<h3> By Laura Franklin </h3>
<h3> April 28, 2020 </h3>
  <p>Non-essential business closures, stay at home orders, and mandatory facial
    coverings in public places were enforced across the country in response to
    the global COVID-19 pandemic. In Prince George’s County, Maryland,
    authorities prepared for the worst when the White House declared that the
    greater Baltimore-Washington area became an emerging hotspot for COVID-19.</p>

<p> Prince George’s County leads with the largest number of cases of the novel
  coronavirus in Maryland. As of April 21, there have been 3,868 confirmed cases
  of COVID-19 and 141 deaths in Prince George’s County according to Prince George’s
   County Department of Health. </p>

   <p> “This virus continues to spread in every single jurisdiction in the state,
     but the concentration of Maryland cases has rapidly intensified particularly
      in the Baltimore-Washington corridor,” said Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan in a press
      conference on March 12, 2020. </p>

    <p> The <a href="http://www.pgchealthzone.org/demographicdata/index/view?id=1500&localeId=1260" target="_blank" > population of Prince George’s County </a> is composed of 62.23% African
      Americans.   </p>

<p> “That means our county - with its rich diversity, well-established African-American
  neighborhoods, and vibrant immigrant neighborhoods - is at higher-risk for difficult or
   negative outcomes from this virus,” Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks
   said in a press release on April 10, 2020. </p>

   <p> Out of the reported deaths, 138 were African American, 17 were Latino, 21
     were White, and 10 were other, <a href= "https://princegeorges.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/9491556559cb4bba8ead3aa72ac3edcf" target="_blank" > according to PG county’s data. </a> </p>
